# Egypt-map-coloring-using-backtracking-algorithm
This project is about coloring Egypt’s map only using 3 colors such that no 2 adjacent regions have the same color.
Created this code using Python programming language and added backtracking technique to the code.
In this project we didn’t use Egypt’s cities maps, however we used Egypt’s regions to create our project upon.

# The output of this code will be as shown here:
